# TowerSwap Tokenlists

Token Lists is a specification for lists of token metadata (e.g. address, decimals, etc.) that can be used by any dApp
interfaces that needs one or more lists of tokens. Anyone can create and maintain a token list, as long as they follow
the specification. The Pangolin community invites you to add your token to our tokenlists!
